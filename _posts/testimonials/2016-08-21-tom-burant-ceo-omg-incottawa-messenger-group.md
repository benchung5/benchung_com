The website's coming along awesomely! Ben's been keeping me updated and the previews he's given me have exceeded my expectations, so I'm a very happy camper there :) ..

Too many businesses neglect sharing info on work progress with their clients. In our business it's critical that we keep our clients informed of our progress and or any expected delays, so consequently we feel we should always be apprised the same as well. You have been absolutely on top of doing that, and that's a very commendable business philosophy.

We contacted Ben about creating a modern web presence for us. In a very short period of time, we have our new website up and running. We are very happy with the service and the final product. We wanted a website we could maintain ourselves, but still present to the public in a professional manner. Ben delivered on both counts!
