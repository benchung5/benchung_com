Ben,

You were right!....had to delete history and there were the new pics of the pups. I'm not very computer smart, just enough to get by, thank you also for being patient and explaining things to me. The pics look a lot better smaller, thanks for the changes and being so quick to get them added. 

I can honestly say, that after all that I have been through with other companies, to me, you are unbelievable!

Just wanted to let you know that you have been great and I am glad I found you, again thank-you
