In my capacity as executive director for the St. Catharines Right to Life Association, I have the pleasure of working with volunteers who offer their time and a wide variety of talents to our charitable group. Ben Chung has truly been a gift to our organization since he became a volunteer in May 2005. Ben has generously used his exceptional artistic skills to assist us with various projects. In his capacity serving on one of our promotion committees, he has designed materials, such as our St. Catharines Right to Life brochure, to help us in our mission to promote respect for life through education. He has also created posters and other resources to assist us in advertising fundraising events.
Ben has always offered his very best on our behalf, producing professional resources and giving expert design advice. Ben is friendly, reliable, highly-skilled and a delight to work with.
I can confidently recommend Ben Chung to provide the best service possible in his field.
Sincerely,

Marlene Tersigni - Executive Director, St. Catharines Right to Life
