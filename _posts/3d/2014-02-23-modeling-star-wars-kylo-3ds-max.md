This video explains the basic workflow of Modeling a Star Wars Kylo Lightsaber in 3DS Max. The concepts can really be applied to any tubular sci-fi weapon or gun. Here are the short-form points from the video:

&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Avoiding pinching when applying turbosmooth over chamfered geometry</li>
	<li>using the layer manager to separate parts while working</li>
	<li>radial duplication</li>
	<li>using instanced geometry</li>
</ul>
