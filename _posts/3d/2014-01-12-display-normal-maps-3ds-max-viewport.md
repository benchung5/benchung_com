This video shows you How to display normal maps in real time in the 3DS Max viewport. I like to keep point form notes like these when anything requires a few steps to do. Sometimes they can be hard to always remember without a "cheat sheet".

In summary, the steps are as follows.
<h3>Displaying normals in 3DSMax</h3>
1. In standard material check on "bump" and change value to 100. insert "normal bump" as input
2. Grab a normalbump map, then plug a bitmap map into it
3. In viewport do: Materials &gt; Realistic Materials with Maps is applied
4. Rendering &gt; gamma/lut setup &gt; Disable Gamma/LUT Correction
