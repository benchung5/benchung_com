excerpt: This video shows you how to export your 3d model from 3DS Max to Mudbox. I've found that there are a number of errors that can happen from wonky geometry to not even being able to preview your model in Mudbox. With a few simple steps, you can minimize chances of error on export from 3DS Max.
