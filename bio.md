        <h2>Ben Chung - Developer & 3D Artist</h2>
        <p>My Current main focus is 3D models and presentations for the web. I have both company and independent experience as a full stack web developer. I also have a background as a 3D artist - creating AAA games at companies as well as on the side as a freelancer.
        Some core principles I believe in:

        <ul>
            <li>Using creativity as a driving force</li> 
            <li>Never ending research (a requirement in the web industry)</li>
            <li>Persistence &#8211; seeing it done the right way as the only option</li>
            <li>Keeping a balanced life. Simplify wherever possible</li>
